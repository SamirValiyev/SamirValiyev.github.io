        Hello. I'm a Junior Full-Stack developer. I'm 19 years old. I first started programming with Android Development as a field. 
        Later I changed my mind to Backend Development and at the same time I'm learning Frontend (React). 
        There are logos of the technologies I've learned at the entrance of my Github page. 
        In addition, the following and or you can get information about what I have learned and what 
        I am learning by clicking on the Technologies link in the navbar part of the page. Thanks !!
